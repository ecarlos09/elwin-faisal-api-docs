# Exercises
We are building a neighbourhood collaboration site and we want to make a system to keep track of people, houses, and addresses of those houses.
   - Each person has a name, age and number of people in their household
   - Each house has an address and an owner
   - Each address has a postcode and street address

The REST API will need to enable users to:
   - Store people, houses and addresses
   - Look up a house, itâ€™s address and owner
   - Look up people in our neighbourhood within certain age brackets and with specific household sizes

***

1. [x] Consider the type of data we will be storing and therefore the type of database we should implement (SQL vs NoSQL)
2. [ .. ] Create a schema for this database
3. [x] Consider the requests our API should be capable of handling
4. [x] List the routes you will need with their HTTP verb and path
5. [x] Determine the responses that should be returned and the content types of these requests and responses

Create documentation for your API on a GitHub Readme. When first making the repo, make a working branch so you can PR back to master later on and request review!
